About The Project
Shopping cart mern is a modern, full-stack e-commerce shopping cart application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for Browse products, adding them to a cart, and managing orders.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and logout.
Product Catalog: Browse a list of available products with details.
Shopping Cart Management:
Add/remove items from the cart.
Adjust product quantities in the cart.
View cart summary and total price.
Responsive UI: Designed to work well on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
[Add any other specific features your project has, e.g., product search, filtering, order history, admin panel, payment integration (even if simulated), etc.]
Tech Stack
Frontend:
React.js â€“ Component-based architecture for dynamic user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
shadcn/ui â€“ Beautiful, headless UI components for a polished design.
Framer Motion â€“ Declarative animations and motion effects for engaging user interactions.
React Router â€“ Client-side routing for navigating between different pages.
Axios â€“ Promise-based HTTP client for efficient API communication.
Backend:
Node.js â€“ Server-side JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
Express.js â€“ Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for building robust APIs.
MongoDB â€“ NoSQL document database for flexible and scalable data storage.
Mongoose â€“ Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js, simplifying data interactions.
JWT (JSON Web Token) â€“ Secure and stateless authentication and authorization for user sessions.
Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js & npm:
Download from nodejs.org.
Verify installation:
Bash

node -v
npm -v
Important Note: This project was developed with Node.js 10.14.2. While it might work on newer versions, if you encounter issues, consider using a Node Version Manager (like nvm for macOS/Linux or nvm-windows for Windows) to install and use the specific version:
Bash

nvm install 10.14.2
nvm use 10.14.2
MongoDB:
Local: Install MongoDB Community Server from mongodb.com/try/download/community and ensure it's running.
Cloud (Recommended for ease): Create a free-tier cluster on MongoDB Atlas. You will get a connection URI to use.
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/ankitjhagithub21/shopping-cart-mern.git
cd shopping-cart-mern
If you intend to push this to your own GitHub repository, remember to set your remote URL:

Bash

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Adarshgupta1127/SHOPPING-CART-MERN.git
Install Server Dependencies:

Bash

cd server
npm install
Install Client Dependencies:

Bash

cd ../client
npm install
Environment Variables
Both the server and client directories require .env files to configure environment-specific settings.

Server Configuration (server/.env)
Create a file named .env in the server directory with the following content (replace placeholders with your actual values):

Code snippet

MONGO_URI=[Your MongoDB Connection URI] # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/shopping_cart_db OR your Atlas URI
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=[A_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY_FOR_JWT_AUTHENTICATION]
MONGO_URI:
For local MongoDB, it's typically mongodb://localhost:27017/[your_database_name].
For MongoDB Atlas, copy the connection string provided in your cluster overview.
PORT: The port the backend server will run on. Default is 5000.
JWT_SECRET: A strong, unique string for signing JSON Web Tokens. Generate a complex one!
Client Configuration (client/.env)
Create a file named .env in the client directory with the following content:

Code snippet

VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Adjust port if your backend runs on a different one
VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL: This should point to the base URL of your backend API. Make sure the port matches your server/.env PORT.
Running the Application
Open two separate terminal windows for the client and server.

Start the Backend Server:

In the first terminal, navigate to the server directory:
Bash

cd shopping-cart-mern/server
Run the server:
Bash

npm start
You should see a message indicating the server is running (e.g., "Server running on port 5000").
Start the Frontend Client:

In the second terminal, navigate to the client directory:
Bash

cd shopping-cart-mern/client
Run the client development server:
Bash

npm run dev
This will typically open the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173 (or similar port assigned by Vite).
Project Structure
The project is divided into two main directories:

client/: Contains the React.js frontend application.
src/: Main source code for the React app.
components/: Reusable React components.
pages/: Top-level page components.
api/ (or services/): API calls using Axios.
assets/: Images, icons, etc.
server/: Contains the Node.js/Express.js backend API.
models/: Mongoose schemas for MongoDB.
routes/: API routes.
controllers/: Logic for handling API requests.
middleware/: Express middleware (e.g., for authentication).
config/: Database connection setup.
API Endpoints (Optional but Recommended)
Here's a brief overview of some expected API endpoints:

Authentication:

POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and return JWT
GET /api/auth/profile - Get authenticated user's profile (requires JWT)
Products:

GET /api/products - Get all products
GET /api/products/:id - Get a single product by ID
Cart:

GET /api/cart - Get user's cart (requires authentication)
POST /api/cart/add - Add item to cart
PUT /api/cart/update - Update item quantity in cart
DELETE /api/cart/remove - Remove item from cart
Orders:

POST /api/orders - Create a new order (requires authentication)
GET /api/orders - Get user's order history (requires authentication)
Usage
Once both the client and server are running:

Open your browser to http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite provides).
Register a new user account or log in if you have one.
Browse the product listings.
Add items to your cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to a simulated checkout.
[Describe any other key interactions or flows a user might experience.]
